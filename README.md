Cyggnets is created to understand the relationship between short-term transcriptomic effects of chemical and biolological perturbation at the same target gene/protein. The original data comes from the LINCS L1000 project, which has been amplified using a cycleGAN deep learning network to full RNA-seq by Jeon et al (see Bioinformatics, 2022, "Transforming L1000 profiles to RNA-seq-like profiles with deep learning").

This repository contains all R code used in the making of Cyggnets. 

All 6,687 precomputed GSEA profiles can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/lunaql/cyggnets/tree/main. 

The interactive web app can be accessed at: https://lqli.shinyapps.io/cyggnets/.
